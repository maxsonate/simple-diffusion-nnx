# Simple Diffusion in NNX
A simple image diffusion model in NNX. NNX is a JAX-based neural network library designed for simplicity and power. Its modular approach follows standard Python conventions, making it both intuitive and compatible with the broader JAX ecosystem. Please note that NNX is experimental and subject to change.

For more information regarding NNX, please refer to https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.3/experimental/nnx/index.html

This work was inspired and derived from the implementation of image diffusion model tutorial of Kaggle. For more information, please refer to the following:

# Backbone
A modified version of the U-Net (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) that uses ResNet blocks instead of simple convolutional blocks. This U-Net will incorporate the time embedding and an additional attention mechanism in every block.
